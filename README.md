Sample residual neural network implementation<br>
12.7 My linux VM crashed and I didn't have back ups for them. Attempting to recover my experimental process on google colab.<br>
12.9 Only recovers the neural network model implementation from google colab, it is a illustration of following the architecture described in this paper.
